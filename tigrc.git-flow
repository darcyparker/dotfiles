# From https://github.com/jonas/tig/blob/master/contrib/git-flow.tigrc
# Bindings for git-flow.
#
# Flow bindings start with the capital F and then follow the first character of
# each operation. If executed from the refs view, the operations (that make
# sense to) work on the selected branch. Otherwise, they work on the currently
# checked out branch.
#
# Commands that finish a flow require confirmation to run. Commands that create
# a new flow prompt for user input and run when that input is accepted with no
# confirmation prompt.
#
# Note: Bindings assume the standard git-flow paths of feature, release, hotfix
# and support.
#
# To use these keybindings copy the file to your HOME directory and include it
# from your ~/.tigrc file:
#
#       $ cp contrib/git-flow.tigrc ~/.tigrc.git-flow
#       $ echo "source ~/.tigrc.git-flow" >> ~/.tigrc

# Get rid of default bindings for F, as that will be the entry point for all
# git-flow related commands with this binding.
