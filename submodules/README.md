# About

Various gists and git repos that I use in my dotfiles are kept here and
files are symlink'd into the appropriate location.

Many of these are [personal gists](https://gist.github.com/darcyparker).  I
don't want to manage copies in multiple git repos, so I am using submodules.

Other's are others' repos and I want to be able to
`git pull origin master --recurse-submodules` periodically to get the latest.
